let us consider removing just enough so that remaining ones still form complete rectangles along outer lines while keeping inner spaces clear.\n\nThus, ideally after careful arrangement ensuring even distribution across top/bottom/left/right could result something close to **6*5 =** *30*.

or not; thus, let's calculate the count of those boundary balls first before moving further into inner calculations.\n\n\n5. **Counting Boundary Black Balls Perimeter-wise**:\nFor a given pyramid size N,\n\n- First Row has one ball per side => Total sides * Rows = 3*N/2\n- Second Row has two balls per side => Total sides * Rows = 9-N/2\n\nThus, combining both rows gives us the formula for counting all unique boundary points across multiple layers as follows:\n\\[ B(N)=frac{(7N – 3)/2}\\]\n\nNow considering our specific case here involving an \"8-Pyramid\", substituting values accordingly yields:\n\\[\nB(8)=(7*8–3)/2 = 27\n\\]\nSo out of initial 36 balls present initially, after removing boundaries leaves remaining ones as:\n\\( W(Balls) = Initial\\_balls - Boundaries = 36-Boundries = 36-(27) = 9.\\)\n\nTherefore, the final answer would simply represent the quantity left over post removals being equal exactly nine itself since no other internal arrangement could fit perfectly without violating conditions set forth earlier regarding distribution patterns around edges exclusively.\n\nConclusion:\nThere must exist precisely three complete sub-level structures fitting neatly together making them form yet again their own miniature version mirroring original pattern but scaled down proportionally maintaining same ratio between heights & widths consistently throughout whole

seems clear and does not contain obvious errors regarding definitions or logical inconsistencies.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand how an \\( n \\)-pyramid is structured:\n\n1.

Adding another row above it creates one more level making up a total height of two levels: that would make it into what could be considered as part of a \"double\" structure but still within our context here - let’s assume by extension, adding rows means increasing complexity rather than just stacking horizontally.\n\nFor clarity:\nA **single** layer consists simply of itself without additional layers stacked upon; hence no white portion exists yet since everything starts from zero initially when counting upwards towards building structures like pyramids.\n\nGiven these points about understanding basic configurations,\nLet us consider constructing step-by-step based off given information:\n\n### Stepwise Construction Analysis\n\n#### Layer Counting Methodology\nWe start at ground truth which implies starting point being empty space till first addition happens i.e., having only one element present signifies initial state wherein nothing else has been added thus far.\n\nAs per your description, you mentioned *\"all the balls\"* implying complete coverage across entire perimeter meaning every position occupied externally must turn out black while leaving center untouched thereby creating contrast between filled vs unfilled spaces inside said figure.\n\nThusly,\n\nIf we visualize filling sequentially outwardwards around edges until reaching desired final count then number of innermost circles left uncolored will give answer directly corresponding exactly matching required condition stated earlier.\n\nTherefore considering edge case scenario where outer shell gets completely colored resulting remaining core area devoided of coloration gives direct insight needed solution.\n\nSo essentially once external boundary reaches completion internal void becomes evident revealing true nature hidden beneath surface indicating actual quantity concealed amidst seemingly complex arrangement.\n\nIn conclusion therefore after careful analysis taking account both structural integrity & visual representation clearly indicates presence of precisely four distinct concentric rings surrounding central nucleus fulfilling criteria outlined originally posed query accurately pointing toward correct interpretation leading ultimately back onto sought-after result namely `4` representing exact amount comprising entirely blank/unfilled region constituting essence behind whole construction process described hereinbefore!"}

Let's denote the side length of the equilateral triangle as \\( s \\).\n\nSince \\( M \\) lies on the minor arc \\( AB \\), it means that angles \\( AMC \\) and \\( BMC \\) will also form part of this same cycle around points A, B, C respectively when considering their positions relative to other arcs or chords within the circle.\n\nGiven these conditions:\n1. The central angle corresponding to any chord connecting two adjacent vertices like \\( AC = BC\\) would measure exactly twice its respective vertex angle because they span half-circle.\n   - Therefore if you consider one such segment say \\(AC\\):\n     $$ ∠AOC=∠BOC=\\frac {3}{4}×(π- π/3)=5π /9$$\n\nNow let’s focus specifically onto our target line segment \\(AM\\).

There might also be confusion regarding whether you want us to find lengths involving specific points like midpoints.\n\nTo resolve this ambiguity properly let’s break down possible interpretations for clarity but first addressing potential issues with wording:\n\n### Possible Interpretations\n\n#### 1\\. Length of Segment Through Point \\(M\\)\nIf by “\\(AM\\)” you mean the line segment connecting vertex \\(A\\) directly across via chord passing through midpoint between vertices along circumference then:\n- Since all sides equal due to being part of same equilateral triangle inscribed within unit circle,\n\\[ |AB| = |\\BC|=|\\CA|. \\]\n\nHowever without further context about exact location/length required makes interpretation ambiguous unless specified otherwise.\n\n\n#### 2\\.
