Horizontal Folds:\nConsider if there could be any line where one half-image overlaps with another when folded horizontally.\nThe image shows four quadrants created by diagonal folds (not horizontal). If you try to align these diagonally mirrored parts vertically or horizontally without overlapping them incorrectly due to their design symmetry, it's clear no simple straight-line horizontal fold will work because they would not match up correctly at all points across an entire row/column unless aligned precisely through centering on specific features like ears or tails - but those aren't symmetrical enough for perfect alignment over multiple rows/cols simultaneously via just a single horizontal crease.\n\nThus: **No valid horizontal fold** exists here!\n\n---\n\n#### 2.

on each side.\nThe number of rotational symmetry groups for this specific geometric figure helps us count unique configurations:\n\n1. **Identify Symmetry Groups**  \n   The group \\( S_4 \\)

symmetry group for an octahedron consists of 24 elements which include rotations about axes passing through opposite vertices or midpoints of edges.\n   \n   - There are three types:\n     * Rotations

But since specific numbers aren't mentioned clearly across other two sides/views too much detail needed.\n\nHowever focusing strictly upon removal possibilities under constraint where none of those particular patterns change implies considering least possible changes maintaining structural integrity per side/view independently.\n\nThus, ideally maximum cube(s) removable would depend heavily also on hidden structures beneath surface level evident visually thus requiring deeper understanding beyond just immediate apparent counts!\n\nIn conclusion,\nWithout precise numerical data corresponding precisely aligned perfectly matching every single block configuration accurately within respective planes simultaneously keeping everything intact otherwise impossible due inherent complexity involved,\n\n**Maximum Cubes Removable Under Given Constraints Could Be Approximately Around ~30**, though actual figure may vary significantly once complete visibility into underlying unseen portions becomes available!"}

When she makes her fold along one side towards another corner diagonally opposite on that same edge, we create an interesting geometric transformation.\n   \n2. **Understand Folding Process**:\n   - By folding from one short end toward its farthest point across the rectangle via a diagonal line, you effectively cut out half of each triangle formed at either top-left and bottom-right corners when unfolded back into full rectangles.\n  \n3. **Area Calculation**:\n    Since both triangles removed have equal areas due symmetry,\n     \\[\n      A_{\\text{triangle}} = 0.5ab\n     \\]\n    \n4. Thus total area taken away equals twice such triangular pieces' combined area:\n       \\[A_{total} = ab-2(0.5ab)=ab-ab=ab/2.\\]\n\nTherefore, after removing these parts, what remains forms our desired shape – which happens to be exactly equivalent to cutting off precisely those portions symmetrically leaving behind just the central part forming a perfect parallelogram whose base length matches width (\\(\\frac{\\sqrt{(l^2 + w)^2}-lw}{w}\\)) but height reduced proportionately accordingly.\n\nThus final calculation yields:\n\\[ Area\\_parallelogram=\\left(a-b\\right)\\times b / 2 .\\] \n\nWithout specific values given here, let us assume standard unit measurements where lengths match widths i.e., square format making calculations simpler yielding exact halves thus simplifying further down to basic arithmetic operations leading directly onto finding resultant value based upon initial parameters set forth initially within problem statement itself!"}
