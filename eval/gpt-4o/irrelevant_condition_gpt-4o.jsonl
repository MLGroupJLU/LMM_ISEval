The adjacent numbers to \\(5\\) must sum to \\(9\\), and they must be valid digits from \\(1\\) to \\(9\\) that are not already placed.\n\n#### Possible placements for \\(5\\):\n- \\(5\\) cannot be in Row 1 or Row 2 because the numbers in those rows are already partially filled and must remain in increasing order.\n- Therefore, \\(5\\) must be in Row 3.\n\n#### Adjacent numbers to \\(5\\):\n- If \\(5\\) is placed in Row 3, its adjacent numbers will depend on its exact position.

This placement is consistent with the adjacency rule.\n\n#### Sum of adjacent numbers:\n- For the sum of adjacent numbers to \\(5\\) to equal \\(9\\), the adjacent numbers must be carefully chosen. However, this condition is **impossible** to satisfy because:\n  - The numbers adjacent to \\(5\\) must be distinct digits from \\(1\\) to \\(9\\), and \\(1, 2, 3, 4\\) are already placed in the table.\n  - The smallest possible sum of two distinct digits adjacent to \\(5\\) is \\(1 + 2 = 3\\), and the largest possible sum is \\(8 + 9 = 17\\).

Specifically:\n- The adjacency condition cannot be satisfied given the constraints of the \\(3 \\times 3\\) table and the requirement that numbers are arranged in increasing order across each row.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThere is an error in the question's premises. The condition that \"the sum of the numbers adjacent to \\(5\\) is \\(9\\)\" is not possible to satisfy under the given constraints. Therefore, the problem is flawed, and no valid solution exists."}

{"pid": 83, "answer_to_normal": "To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze the conversation and the figures provided.\n\n### Step 1: Adam's statement\nAdam says:  \n\"I don't know what Carla's favorite figure is and I know that Bruna doesn't know either.\"\n\nThis means that based on the **color** (which Adam knows), Adam cannot uniquely identify Carla's favorite figure. Additionally, Adam knows that Bruna cannot uniquely identify the favorite figure based on the **shape** (which Bruna knows).  \n\nFrom this, we can infer that the color Adam knows must correspond to multiple shapes, and the shape Bruna knows must correspond to multiple colors.\n\n### Step 2: Bruna's statement\nBruna says:  \n\"At first I didn't know what Carla's favorite figure was, but now I know.\"\n\nThis means that after hearing Adam's statement, Bruna is able to uniquely identify Carla's favorite figure. This implies that Bruna can now eliminate all possibilities except one based on the **shape** she knows and the information Adam provided.\n\n### Step 3: Adam's second statement\nAdam says:  \n\"Now I know too.\"\n\nThis means that after hearing Bruna's statement, Adam is able to uniquely identify Carla's favorite figure. This implies that Adam can now eliminate all possibilities except one based on the **color** he knows and the information Bruna provided.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the figures\nThe figures are:  \n(A) Pink circle  \n(B) Green square  \n(C) Green star  \n(D) White square  \n(E) Pink triangle  \n\n#### Color analysis:\n- **Pink**: Appears in (A) and (E) → two shapes (circle and triangle).  \n- **Green**: Appears in (B) and (C) → two shapes (square and star).  \n- **White**: Appears in (D) → one shape (square).  \n\n#### Shape analysis:\n- **Circle**: Appears in (A) → one color (pink).  \n- **Square**: Appears in (B) and (D) → two colors (green and white).  \n- **Star**: Appears in (C) → one color (green).  \n- **Triangle**: Appears in (E) → one color (pink).  \n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Deduce Carla's favorite figure\n#### Adam's perspective:\nAdam knows the **color**.  \n- If Adam knows the color is **pink**, he sees (A) and (E). He cannot uniquely identify the figure because there are two shapes (circle and triangle).  \n- If Adam knows the color is **green**, he sees (B) and (C). He cannot uniquely identify the figure because there are two shapes (square and star).  \n- If Adam knows the color is **white**, he sees (D). He can uniquely identify the figure because there is only one shape (square).  \n\nThus, Adam cannot know the favorite figure initially if the color is pink or green, but he can if the color is white.\n\n#### Bruna's perspective:\nBruna knows the **shape**.  \n- If Bruna knows the shape is **circle**, she sees (A). She can uniquely identify the figure because there is only one color (pink).  \n- If Bruna knows the shape is **square**, she sees (B) and (D). She cannot uniquely identify the figure because there are two colors (green and white).  \n- If Bruna knows the shape is **star**, she sees (C). She can uniquely identify the figure because there is only one color (green).  \n- If Bruna knows the shape is **triangle**, she sees (E). She can uniquely identify the figure because there is only one color (pink).  \n\nThus, Bruna cannot know the favorite figure initially if the shape is square, but she can if the shape is circle, star, or triangle.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Combine the information\nFrom Adam's first statement, we know that Bruna initially does not know the favorite figure. This means the shape must be **square**, as it is the only shape that corresponds to multiple colors (green and white).  \n\nFrom Bruna's second statement, we know that after hearing Adam, she is able to uniquely identify the favorite figure. This means Adam's color information must eliminate one of the possibilities for the square.  \n\nFrom Adam's second statement, we know that after hearing Bruna, he is able to uniquely identify the favorite figure.

This means there are **multiple figures of the same color**.\n- Adam also knows that Bruna cannot determine the favorite figure based on the shape. This implies there are **multiple figures of the same shape**.\n\n#### Bruna: \"At first I didn't know what Carla's favorite figure was, but now I know.\"\n- Initially, Bruna couldn't determine the favorite figure based on the shape. This confirms there were **multiple figures of the same shape**.\n- After hearing Adam's statement, Bruna can now determine the favorite figure. This means **the color information eliminates ambiguity for Bruna**.\n\n#### Adam: \"Now I know too.\"\n- After hearing Bruna's statement, Adam can now determine the favorite figure. This means **the shape information eliminates ambiguity for Adam**.\n\n### Step-by-Step Deduction:\n#### Step 1: Analyze the figures based on color.\n- **Pink figures**: Circle (A) and Triangle (E).\n- **Green figures**: Square (B) and Star (C).\n- **White figures**: Hexagon and Square (D).\n\nAdam knows the color but cannot determine the favorite figure. This means there are **multiple figures of the same color**. Thus, Carla's favorite figure is either **pink, green, or white**.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze the figures based on shape.\n- **Circle**: Pink (A).\n- **Square**: Green (B) and White (D).\n- **Star**: Green (C) and White.\n- **Triangle**: Pink (E).\n- **Hexagon**: White.\n\nBruna knows the shape but initially cannot determine the favorite figure. This means there are **multiple figures of the same shape**. Thus, Carla's favorite figure is either **square, star, or triangle**.\n\n#### Step 3: Combine the information.\n- Adam's statement (\"I know Bruna doesn't know either\") implies that **both color and shape initially have ambiguity**.\n- Bruna's statement (\"Now I know\") implies that **color resolves the ambiguity for her**. This means the favorite figure's color is unique among the shapes Bruna is considering.\n- Adam's final statement (\"Now I know too\") implies that **shape resolves the ambiguity for him**.\n\n#### Step 4: Narrow down the possibilities.\n- If Carla's favorite figure is **pink**, the options are Circle (A) and Triangle (E). Bruna initially cannot distinguish between these based on shape, but Adam's color information (pink) helps her resolve the ambiguity. Thus, Carla's favorite figure must be **Triangle (E)**.\n\n### Final Answer:\nCarla's favorite figure is **Triangle (E)**.", "answer_to_ill_with_hint": "Let's analyze the conversation and the images to determine Carla's favorite figure.\n\n1. **Adam's Statement**: \"I don't know what Carla's favorite figure is and I know that Bruna doesn't know either.\"\n   - Adam knows the color but not the shape. If he knows Bruna doesn't know either, it means the color Carla told Adam must be shared by multiple shapes, so Bruna can't determine the favorite shape based on shape alone.\n   - From the images, the green color is shared by multiple shapes (square and star), while the pink color is unique to the circle and triangle. Therefore, Carla's favorite figure cannot be pink, because if it were, Bruna could potentially know the shape.\n\n2. **Bruna's Statement**: \"At first I didn't know what Carla's favorite figure was, but now I know.\"\n   - Bruna initially didn't know, which means the shape Carla told her must be shared by multiple colors. The star shape is shared by green and white, while the square is shared by green and white. The triangle is shared by pink and white. The circle is only pink, and the hexagon is only white.\n   - After Adam's statement, Bruna can now determine the favorite figure. This means the shape Carla told her must be one that, when combined with the knowledge that the color is green, leads to a unique figure. The star shape fits this criterion because it is green in the images.\n\n3. **Adam's Final Statement**: \"Now I know too.\"\n   - Adam can now determine the favorite figure based on Bruna's statement. Since Bruna now knows, the shape must be the star, and Adam knows the color is green, confirming the favorite figure is the green star.\n\nTherefore, Carla's favorite figure is the green star (option C)."}

The side length of the hexagon is half the side length of the equilateral triangle.\n\nFor an equilateral triangle with area 1, the side length \\( s \\) can be found using the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 = 1\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( s \\), we get:\n\n\\[\ns^2 = \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]\n\n\\[\ns = \\sqrt{\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}}}\n\\]\n\nThe side length of the hexagon is half of this, so:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Side length of hexagon} = \\frac{s}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}}}}{2}\n\\]\n\nThe area of a regular hexagon with side length \\( a \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of hexagon} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} a^2\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the side length of the hexagon:\n\n\\[\na = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}}}}{2}\n\\]\n\n\\[\na^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}}}}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4}{4\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]\n\nNow, calculate the area of the hexagon:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of hexagon} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{3}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{3}{2\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying further:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area of hexagon} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n\\]\n\nThus, the area of the grey hexagon is \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\).", "answer_to_ill_with_hint": "The question contains an error in its premises. Specifically, the description of the small triangles formed at each vertex outside the hexagon is incorrect. The triangles described as having \"two right angles\" cannot exist because a triangle can only have one right angle at most. \n\nAdditionally, the description of the hexagon formed by drawing perpendicular lines from the midpoints of each side to the other two sides is unclear. The diagram shows a hexagon formed by connecting certain points, but the description does not accurately explain how these points are determined.\n\nTo address the main question regarding the area of the grey hexagon, we need to consider the correct geometric construction. In an equilateral triangle, if perpendiculars are drawn from the midpoints of each side to the opposite sides, they will intersect at the centroid of the triangle, forming a smaller equilateral triangle inside the original triangle. However, the hexagon in the diagram is formed by connecting the points where these perpendiculars intersect the sides of the triangle.\n\nGiven that the area of the original equilateral triangle is 1, the area of the grey hexagon can be calculated using geometric properties and symmetry. The grey hexagon is a regular hexagon formed by connecting the midpoints of the segments created by the perpendiculars. The area of this hexagon is typically a fraction of the area of the original triangle.\n\nFor an equilateral triangle with area 1, the side length \\( s \\) can be found using the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle: \n\\[ \\text{Area} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 = 1 \\]\nSolving for \\( s \\), we get:\n\\[ s^2 = \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}} \\]\n\\[ s = \\sqrt{\\frac{4}{\\sqrt{3}}} \\]\n\nThe grey hexagon is formed by connecting the midpoints of the segments created by the perpendiculars, and its area can be calculated using the properties of the equilateral triangle and the symmetry of the construction. The area of the hexagon is typically \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) of the area of the original triangle, which is \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times 1 = \\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nTherefore, the area of the grey hexagon is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\)."}

{"pid": 844, "answer_to_normal": "To solve this problem, we need to place the integers 1 through 12 in a \\(2 \\times 6\\) grid such that the difference between numbers in adjacent cells is not divisible by 3. We will first analyze the given condition and then count the number of valid arrangements.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Condition\nThe condition states that for any two adjacent cells, the difference between the numbers in those cells should not be divisible by 3. This means that if a number \\(a\\) is placed in a cell, then any adjacent cell cannot contain a number \\(b\\) such that \\(a \\equiv b \\pmod{3}\\).\n\n### Step 2: Classifying Numbers by Modulo 3\nThe numbers 1 through 12 can be classified based on their residues modulo 3:\n- Numbers congruent to 0 modulo 3: \\(3, 6, 9, 12\\)\n- Numbers congruent to 1 modulo 3: \\(1, 4, 7, 10\\)\n- Numbers congruent to 2 modulo 3: \\(2, 5, 8, 11\\)\n\n### Step 3: Arranging the Numbers\nTo satisfy the condition, adjacent cells must contain numbers from different residue classes. One possible arrangement is to alternate residue classes in a checkerboard pattern. For example, we can place numbers congruent to 1 modulo 3 in one set of alternating cells and numbers congruent to 2 modulo 3 in the other set, with numbers congruent to 0 modulo 3 filling the remaining cells.\n\n### Step 4: Counting the Arrangements\nWe can choose any of the three residue classes to start with in the top-left cell. Let's assume we start with numbers congruent to 1 modulo 3 in the top-left cell. The arrangement can be as follows:\n\n- Top row: \\(1, 5, 7, 11, 3, 9\\)\n- Bottom row: \\(2, 4, 8, 10, 6, 12\\)\n\nThis arrangement satisfies the condition because no two adjacent numbers are congruent modulo 3.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Number of Arrangements\nFor each residue class, we have 4 numbers. We can permute these numbers within their respective positions. Therefore, the number of ways to arrange the numbers is:\n\\[\n4! \\times 4! \\times 4! = 24 \\times 24 \\times 24 = 13824\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Finding the Number of Divisors of \\(N\\)\nThe number of divisors of a number is determined by its prime factorization.

This ensures that the difference between any two adjacent numbers is not divisible by \\(3\\).\n\nTo generalize, we can place all odd numbers in one row and all even numbers in the other row.

We know the distances from N to LM and KL:\n- Distance from N to LM = 1\n- Distance from N to KL = 8\n\nSince LM is a vertical line at x = a, the distance from N to LM being 1 means that the x-coordinate of N is a - 1.\n\nSince KL is a horizontal line at y = 0, the distance from N to KL being 8 means that the y-coordinate of N is 8.\n\nTherefore, the coordinates of N are (a - 1, 8).\n\nNow, we substitute the coordinates of N into the equation of KM to find a relationship between a and b:\n- 8 = (-b/a)(a - 1) + b\n- 8 = -b + (b/a) + b\n- 8 = (b/a)\n\nFrom this equation, we find that:\n- b = 8a\n\nNow, we need to find the length of LM, which is the vertical side of the rectangle:\n- LM = b = 8a\n\nTo find the value of a, we use the fact that the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides.

Each cube has 6 faces.\n2. There are 10 cubes, so there are a total of 60 faces.\n3. We need to subtract the faces that are not visible (i.e., the faces that are internal and touching other cubes).\n\nAnalyzing the structure:\n- The bottom layer consists of 6 cubes arranged in a 3x2 formation.\n- The top layer consists of 4 cubes.\n\nFor the bottom layer:\n- The 6 cubes have 6 faces each, totaling 36 faces.\n- The bottom layer has 12 internal faces (each cube in the bottom layer has 2 faces touching other cubes).\n\nFor the top layer:\n- The 4 cubes have 6 faces each, totaling 24 faces.\n- The top layer has 8 internal faces (each cube in the top layer has 2 faces touching other cubes).\n\nTotal painted faces:\n- Total faces: 60\n- Internal faces: 12 (bottom layer) + 8 (top layer) = 20\n- Painted faces: 60 - 20 = 40\n\nTherefore, assuming Roman painted the bottom faces, 40 faces of the cubes are painted."}

The map is a grid with 12 cities and 17 roads, forming a 3x4 rectangle.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the structure of the grid:\n\n- The grid has 3 rows and 4 columns.\n- Each row has 3 horizontal roads, totaling \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) horizontal roads.\n- Each column has 2 vertical roads, totaling \\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\) vertical roads.\n- Therefore, the total number of roads is \\(9 + 8 = 17\\).\n\nPaula needs to travel along 13 roads.

However, Paula needs to use only 13 out of 17 roads, not all roads.\n\n2. **Path Construction**: We need to construct a path that uses 13 roads.

Since the grid is symmetric, we can try different starting paths and check if they lead to \\(L\\) using 13 roads.\n\nGiven the symmetry and the constraints, the number of different routes can be calculated by considering different permutations of the path that satisfy the conditions.\n\nHowever, due to the complexity and symmetry, a detailed enumeration or algorithmic approach is needed to count all possible paths. This requires computational methods or deeper combinatorial analysis.\n\nThus, the number of different routes Paula can take is a complex combinatorial problem that requires enumeration of all valid paths satisfying the conditions.\n\nThe answer is not straightforward without computational assistance or deeper combinatorial analysis.", "answer_to_ill": "To solve this problem, we need to find the number of Eulerian paths in the given grid graph. An Eulerian path is a path that uses every edge exactly once. In this case, Paula wants to travel along exactly 13 roads, starting at city \\(A\\) and ending at city \\(L\\).\n\nFirst, let's analyze the grid graph. The graph is a 3x4 grid, with 12 vertices and 17 edges. The vertices are labeled as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{cccc}\nA & B & C & D \\\\\nE & F & G & H \\\\\nI & J & K & L \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThe edges are the connections between these vertices, forming the grid. The vertices \\(A\\) and \\(L\\) are the starting and ending points of the path.\n\nFor an Eulerian path to exist in a graph, there must be exactly two vertices of odd degree (the starting and ending vertices), and all other vertices must have even degree. Let's check the degrees of the vertices:\n\n- \\(A\\) has degree 2 (connected to \\(B\\) and \\(E\\)).\n- \\(B\\) has degree 3 (connected to \\(A\\), \\(C\\), and \\(F\\)).\n- \\(C\\) has degree 3 (connected to \\(B\\), \\(D\\), and \\(G\\)).\n- \\(D\\) has degree 2 (connected to \\(C\\) and \\(H\\)).\n- \\(E\\) has degree 3 (connected to \\(A\\), \\(F\\), and \\(I\\)).\n- \\(F\\) has degree 4 (connected to \\(B\\), \\(E\\), \\(G\\), and \\(J\\)).\n- \\(G\\) has degree 4 (connected to \\(C\\), \\(F\\), \\(H\\), and \\(K\\)).\n- \\(H\\) has degree 3 (connected to \\(D\\), \\(G\\), and \\(L\\)).\n- \\(I\\) has degree 2 (connected to \\(E\\) and \\(J\\)).\n- \\(J\\) has degree 3 (connected to \\(F\\), \\(I\\), and \\(K\\)).\n- \\(K\\) has degree 3 (connected to \\(G\\), \\(J\\), and \\(L\\)).\n- \\(L\\) has degree 2 (connected to \\(H\\) and \\(K\\)).\n\nThe vertices with odd degrees are \\(B\\), \\(C\\), \\(E\\), \\(H\\), \\(J\\), and \\(K\\). However, for an Eulerian path, we need exactly two vertices of odd degree. Therefore, we need to adjust the graph to have only two vertices of odd degree.\n\nTo achieve this, we can add an extra edge between two vertices of odd degree, effectively making their degrees even. Let's add an edge between \\(B\\) and \\(C\\), and another between \\(J\\) and \\(K\\). This adjustment will make the degrees of \\(B\\), \\(C\\), \\(J\\), and \\(K\\) even, leaving \\(A\\) and \\(L\\) as the only vertices with odd degrees.\n\nNow, the graph has 19 edges, and we need to find an Eulerian path from \\(A\\) to \\(L\\). The number of Eulerian paths in a graph with two vertices of odd degree can be calculated using the formula for Eulerian paths in a grid graph. However, since the graph is small, we can count the paths manually.\n\nAfter adding the edges, the graph becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{cccc}\nA & B & C & D \\\\\nE & F & G & H \\\\\nI & J & K & L \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nWith additional edges \\(B-C\\) and \\(J-K\\), the degrees are adjusted, and the graph now has 19 edges. The number of Eulerian paths from \\(A\\) to \\(L\\) in this adjusted graph is 2.\n\nTherefore, Paula can take 2 different routes from city \\(A\\) to city \\(L\\) using exactly 13 roads without traveling along any portion of a road more than once.", "answer_to_ill_with_hint": "The problem states that there are 12 cities and 17 roads, and Paula wishes to travel along exactly 13 of those roads, starting at city A and ending at city L.

The number of cities (vertices) in this grid is \\(3 \\times 4 = 12\\), which matches the problem statement.\n3. The number of roads (edges) in this grid can be calculated as follows:\n   - Horizontal roads: There are 3 rows, each with 3 horizontal roads, totaling \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) horizontal roads.\n   - Vertical roads: There are 4 columns, each with 2 vertical roads, totaling \\(4 \\times 2 = 8\\) vertical roads.\n   - Total roads: \\(9 + 8 = 17\\), which matches the problem statement.\n\nThe problem asks Paula to travel along exactly 13 roads, starting at city A and ending at city L, without traveling along any portion of a road more than once. This implies that Paula is looking for a path that uses 13 edges in the grid.\n\nHowever, there is a fundamental issue with the problem's premises. In a grid with 17 edges, a path that uses 13 edges and starts and ends at different vertices (A and L) would require the path to be an Eulerian path. An Eulerian path in a graph is a path that visits every edge exactly once and starts and ends at different vertices. For an Eulerian path to exist, the graph must have exactly two vertices of odd degree, which would be the start and end vertices.\n\nIn the given grid, each vertex has an even degree (either 2 or 3), which means there are no vertices of odd degree. Therefore, it is impossible to have an Eulerian path in this grid. Consequently, the requirement for Paula to travel along exactly 13 roads starting at city A and ending at city L without repeating any road is not feasible given the structure of the grid.\n\nThus, the error in the problem's premises is that it asks for a path that cannot exist in the given grid configuration."}

This problem can be approached by finding a minimum vertex cover for the graph represented by the towns and roads.\n\nAnalyzing the diagram, we can see that the towns form a grid-like structure. A strategic approach is to place power plants in a way that maximizes coverage with the fewest number of plants. One effective method is to place power plants in every alternate town in a checkerboard pattern.\n\nFor this specific diagram, we can place power plants in the following towns:\n- In the first row, place power plants in the 2nd and 4th towns.\n- In the second row, place power plants in the 1st and 3rd towns.\n- In the third row, place power plants in the 2nd and 4th towns.\n- In the fourth row, place power plants in the 1st and 3rd towns.\n\nThis results in a total of 8 power plants, which ensures that every town is either directly covered or covered by a neighboring town.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of power plants that have to be built is 8.", "answer_to_ill_with_hint": "The diagram shows a map with 16 towns connected via roads, but there is no indication of distinct clusters or varying elevations as mentioned in the question. The towns appear to be arranged in a grid-like pattern without any visible grouping or elevation differences. Therefore, the premise of the towns being grouped into four distinct clusters with varying elevations is incorrect based on the provided diagram.\n\nTo determine the minimum number of power plants needed, we can treat this as a graph problem where each town is a node and each road is an edge. The goal is to cover all nodes with the minimum number of power plants, where each plant covers its own node and all directly connected nodes.\n\nAnalyzing the grid pattern, a strategic placement of power plants can be done by selecting nodes such that all nodes are covered. One efficient way is to place power plants in a checkerboard pattern, which ensures coverage of all nodes. For a 4x4 grid, placing power plants in every alternate node (like a checkerboard) will cover all nodes.\n\nThus, the minimum number of power plants required is 8, placed in a checkerboard pattern across the grid."}

The maximum number of cubes is determined by the overlap of these views:\n\n- The \"von oben\" view suggests a maximum footprint of 10 cubes.\n- The \"von vorne\" and \"von rechts\" views suggest a maximum height of 3 cubes in some columns.\n\nBy combining these views, the maximum number of cubes that can be used is 14.

The optimal configuration is a checkerboard pattern, where each white square is adjacent to the maximum number of black squares possible.\n\nIn a checkerboard pattern:\n- Each white square can be adjacent to up to 4 black squares (if it's not on the edge or corner).\n- However, in a large rectangle, edge and corner effects reduce this number.\n\nFor a large rectangle, the maximum adjacency occurs when each white square is adjacent to 2 black squares on average. This is because:\n- In a checkerboard pattern, half of the squares are white and half are black.\n- Each black square is adjacent to 4 white squares, and each white square is adjacent to 4 black squares.\n\nGiven 2018 squares, the optimal configuration is approximately half white and half black:\n- Number of white squares ≈ 1009\n- Number of black squares ≈ 1009\n\nEach white square contributes 2 to the sum (on average), so the maximum sum is:\n\\[ \\text{Maximum sum} = 1009 \\times 2 = 2018 \\]\n\nTherefore, the biggest number that can be obtained as the sum of all numbers in the white squares is 2018."}

This is a classic problem of finding a permutation matrix with given row and column sums.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange 12 shaded squares in a \\(6 \\times 4\\) grid such that each row has exactly 2 shaded squares and each column has exactly 3 shaded squares is given by the multinomial coefficient:\n\n\\[\nN = \\frac{12!}{(2!)^6 \\cdot (3!)^4}\n\\]\n\nCalculating each part:\n\n- \\(12! = 479001600\\)\n- \\((2!)^6 = 64\\)\n- \\((3!)^4 = 1296\\)\n\nThus,\n\n\\[\nN = \\frac{479001600}{64 \\times 1296} = \\frac{479001600}{82944} = 5775\n\\]\n\nFinally, we find the remainder when \\(N\\) is divided by 1000:\n\n\\[\n5775 \\div 1000 = 5 \\quad \\text{remainder} \\quad 775\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the remainder when \\(N\\) is divided by 1000 is \\(\\boxed{775}\\)."}
{"pid": 969, "answer_to_normal": "To determine how many ways there are to colour the cells of the \\(4 \\times 4\\) table, we must satisfy the constraints set by the numbers (indicating the number of black cells) for each row and column.\n\nFirst, let's review the constraints:\n\n- Rows must have:\n  - Row 1: 2 black cells\n  - Row 2: 0 black cells\n  - Row 3: 1 black cell\n  - Row 4: 1 black cell\n\n- Columns must have:\n  - Column 1: 2 black cells\n  - Column 2: 0 black cells\n  - Column 3: 1 black cell\n  - Column 4: 1 black cell\n\nNow, let's logically deduce correct configurations:\n\n1. **Column 2** must have 0 black cells (all cells are white).\n\n2. **Column 1** must have 2 black cells.

A line passing through exactly two points can be formed by choosing any two adjacent dots in a column.\n   - There are 3 such pairs in each column.\n   - With 4 columns, this gives us \\(4 \\times 3 = 12\\) vertical lines.\n\n3. **Diagonal Lines**:\n   - Diagonal lines can be formed in two directions: from top-left to bottom-right and from top-right to bottom-left.\n   - For diagonals from top-left to bottom-right, consider the diagonals that pass through exactly two points:\n     - Starting from the first row, the diagonals are: (1,1)-(2,2), (2,1)-(3,2), (3,1)-(4,2), (1,2)-(2,3), (2,2)-(3,3), (3,2)-(4,3), (1,3)-(2,4), (2,3)-(3,4), (3,3)-(4,4).\n     - There are 9 such diagonals.\n   - For diagonals from top-right to bottom-left, consider the diagonals that pass through exactly two points:\n     - Starting from the first row, the diagonals are: (1,4)-(2,3), (2,4)-(3,3), (3,4)-(4,3), (1,3)-(2,2), (2,3)-(3,2), (3,3)-(4,2), (1,2)-(2,1), (2,2)-(3,1), (3,2)-(4,1).\n     - There are 9 such diagonals.\n\nAdding these up, we have:\n- 12 horizontal lines\n- 12 vertical lines\n- 9 top-left to bottom-right diagonals\n- 9 top-right to bottom-left diagonals\n\nThus, the total number of lines that pass through exactly two points is \\(12 + 12 + 9 + 9 = 42\\).\n\nTherefore, there are 42 lines that pass through exactly two points in the hexagonal grid.", "answer_to_ill_with_hint": "The question states that the hexagonal grid contains four distinct rows of dots and an equal number of columns. However, upon examining the provided image, it is clear that the grid does not have an equal number of rows and columns. The grid has 5 rows and 5 columns, but the arrangement is such that it forms a hexagonal shape, not a square grid.\n\nNow, let's address the main question: how many lines pass through exactly two points in the hexagonal grid?\n\nTo solve this, we need to consider lines in three directions: horizontal, vertical, and diagonal (both left-to-right and right-to-left).\n\n1. **Horizontal Lines:**\n   - Each row has 5 points, and we need to find lines that pass through exactly two points.\n   - For each row, we can choose any two points to form a line. The number of ways to choose 2 points from 5 is given by the combination formula C(5, 2) = 10.\n   - Since there are 5 rows, the total number of horizontal lines is 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n2. **Vertical Lines:**\n   - Similarly, each column has 5 points.\n   - For each column, the number of ways to choose 2 points is also C(5, 2) = 10.\n   - With 5 columns, the total number of vertical lines is 5 * 10 = 50.\n\n3. **Diagonal Lines (Left-to-Right and Right-to-Left):**\n   - For diagonals, we need to consider lines that pass through exactly two points in each diagonal direction.\n   - The diagonals vary in length, and we need to count the number of lines for each possible diagonal length.\n\n   **Left-to-Right Diagonals:**\n   - Diagonals of length 2: 2 diagonals, each contributing 1 line.\n   - Diagonals of length 3: 2 diagonals, each contributing 3 lines (C(3, 2) = 3).\n   - Diagonals of length 4: 2 diagonals, each contributing 6 lines (C(4, 2) = 6).\n   - Diagonals of length 5: 1 diagonal, contributing 10 lines (C(5, 2) = 10).\n\n   Total for left-to-right diagonals = 2*1 + 2*3 + 2*6 + 1*10 = 2 + 6 + 12 + 10 = 30.\n\n   **Right-to-Left Diagonals:**\n   - The count is symmetric to the left-to-right diagonals, so it also contributes 30 lines.\n\nAdding all these, the total number of lines that pass through exactly two points is:\n50 (horizontal) + 50 (vertical) + 30 (left-to-right diagonal) + 30 (right-to-left diagonal) = 160.\n\nTherefore, there are 160 lines that pass through exactly two points in the hexagonal grid."}
