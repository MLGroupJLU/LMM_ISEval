This positioning is crucial for understanding the geometry involved and calculating the angle marked by the question mark.\n\nTo find the angle, we can use the properties of equilateral triangles and squares. Since the triangle is equilateral, all its angles are 60 degrees. The squares, being squares, have right angles (90 degrees) at their vertices.\n\nLet's denote the angle between the side of the triangle and the line connecting the vertices of the two squares as θ. This angle is formed by extending one side of the triangle and connecting it to the vertex of the larger square.\n\nSince the triangle is equilateral, the angle at the vertex opposite to the side in question is also 60 degrees. The angle between the sides of the triangle at this vertex is therefore 120 degrees (180 - 60).\n\nNow, consider the right triangle formed by the side of the triangle, the line connecting the vertices of the two squares, and the line segment connecting the vertex of the smaller square to the point where the line connecting the vertices of the squares intersects the side of the triangle. This right triangle has a 90-degree angle at the vertex of the smaller square, a 60-degree angle at the vertex of the triangle, and the angle θ we are trying to find.\n\nUsing the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we can write:\nθ + 90 + 60 = 180\nθ + 150 = 180\nθ = 180 - 150\nθ = 30 degrees\n\nTherefore, the size of the angle marked by the question mark is 30 degrees."}

Since the wagons are offset by 5 positions, we can calculate the corresponding wagon number in the first train as follows:\n\n\\[\nA_{11} = B_{11} - 5\n\\]\n\nTherefore, wagon number 11 of the second train is side by side with wagon number \\( 11 - 5 = 6 \\) of the first train.\n\nSo, the wagon that is side by side with wagon number 11 is wagon number 6.", "answer_to_ill_with_hint": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the wagon numbers of the two trains when they are side by side.\n\nGiven:\n- Each train has 31 numbered wagons.\n- The trains are traveling in opposite directions.\n- Wagon number 7 of one train is side by side with wagon number 12 of the other train.\n\nFirst, let's determine the direction of the trains. Since the trains are traveling in opposite directions, we can label one train as \"Train A\" and the other as \"Train B.\" When wagon number 7 of Train A is side by side with wagon number 12 of Train B, it means that the wagons are aligned in a specific order.\n\nTo find which wagon is side by side with wagon number 11, we need to consider the relative positions of the wagons. Since wagon number 7 of Train A is aligned with wagon number 12 of Train B, we can infer that the wagons are offset by 5 positions (12 - 7 = 5).\n\nNow, let's apply this offset to wagon number 11.

The sum must be divisible by 3.\n\n   Let's add up all the numbers from 1 to 7:\n   \\[\n   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28\n   \\]\n\n   Since 28 is divisible by 3, the target sum for each line is 28 divided by 3, which is 9.33 (rounded to two decimal places). However, since we are dealing with whole numbers, we will aim for a sum of 9 for each line.\n\n3. **Distribute the numbers**: Now, we need to distribute the numbers 1 to 7 among the circles so that each line sums up to 9.\n\n   - **Top line**: The numbers in this line should add up to 9. Let's place 3 in the top circle and 3 and 3 in the two circles below it.\n   - **Middle line**: The numbers in this line should also add up to 9. Let's place 2, 3, and 4 in the three circles.\n   - **Bottom line**: Similarly, the numbers in this line should add up to 9. Let's place 1, 3, and 5 in the three circles.\n\n4. **Verify the sums**:\n   - Top line: \\(3 + 3 + 3 = 9\\)\n   - Middle line: \\(2 + 3 + 4 = 9\\)\n   - Bottom line: \\(1 + 3 + 5 = 9\\)\n\nAll the lines have the same sum of 9.

The top line has a sum of 1, the middle line has a sum of 9, and the bottom line has a sum of 18. To meet the criteria, we need to adjust the placement of the numbers.\n\nAfter some trial and error, we find that the following placement satisfies the condition:\n- Top circle: 7\n- Second row, left circle: 1\n- Second row, middle circle: 5\n- Second row, right circle: 3\n- Bottom row, left circle: 2\n- Bottom row, middle circle: 6\n- Bottom row, right circle: 4\n\nNow, let's calculate the sums along each line again:\n- Top line (1 circle): 7\n- Middle line (3 circles): 1 + 5 + 3 = 9\n- Bottom line (3 circles): 2 + 6 + 4 = 12\n\nThis time, the sums along the lines are all different: 7, 9, and 12.

If only one student received $3$ extra points, then the new median would be $85$. \n\nHowever, if more than one student received $3$ extra points, the median would increase by more than $3$ points.

However, the figure provided shows only five squares, which means it is impossible to place six digits in these squares.\n\n2. **Sum of Vertical Column**: The question mentions that the sum of the entries in the vertical column is 23.

Therefore, the given sum of 23 is incorrect.\n\n3. **Sum of Two Entries Among the Columns**: The question states that the sum of two entries among the columns is 11. This is also incorrect because, with the given digits, the minimum sum of two entries would be 1 + 2 = 3, and the maximum sum would be 9 + 8 = 17. Thus, a sum of 11 is not possible.\n\n4. **Sum of Horizontal Row**: The question correctly states that the sum of the entries in the horizontal row is 12. However, this information alone is not sufficient to determine the sum of all six digits since we are missing one digit.\n\nGiven these errors, it is not possible to accurately determine the sum of the six digits used based on the information provided.

Each slice of the pie represents the percentage of students who prefer that particular sport.\n\nFor East Junior High School:\n- The pie chart indicates that 20% of students prefer tennis.\n- Since there are 2000 students at East, this means that 20% of 2000 students, or 400 students, prefer tennis.\n\nFor West Middle School:\n- The pie chart shows that 25% of students prefer tennis.\n- With 2500 students at West, this translates to 25% of 2500 students, or 625 students, who prefer tennis.\n\nNow, to find the total percentage of students who prefer tennis across both schools, we add the number of students who prefer tennis at each school and divide by the total number of students across both schools:\n\nTotal students who prefer tennis = 400 (East) + 625 (West) = 1025 students\n\nTotal number of students across both schools = 2000 (East) + 2500 (West) = 4500 students\n\nPercentage of students who prefer tennis = (Total students who prefer tennis / Total number of students) * 100\n= (1025 / 4500) * 100\n= 0.2278 * 100\n= 22.78%\n\nTherefore, the percentage of students who prefer tennis across both East Junior High School and West Middle School is approximately 22.78%.", "answer_to_ill": "To determine the percent of students who prefer tennis at East Junior High School and West Middle School combined, we need to look at the pie charts provided for each school. \n\nFor East Junior High School, the pie chart shows that 20% of students prefer tennis.

The volume of a cube is given by the formula $V = s^3$, where $s$ is the side length. Since only a portion of the cube is submerged, we need to multiply the volume of the entire cube by the fraction of the cube that is submerged. The fraction of the cube that is submerged is equal to the height of the submerged portion divided by the total height of the cube, which is $8$ feet. Therefore, the volume of the submerged portion of the cube is:\n\n$$V_{\\text{submerged}} = \\left(\\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{8}\\right) \\times 8^3 = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 4\\sqrt{3} \\times 512 = 2\\sqrt{3} \\times 512 = 1024\\sqrt{3}$$\n\nSince the barrel is full of water, the volume of water displaced by the cube is equal to the volume of the submerged portion of the cube. Therefore, $v = 1024\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nTo find $v^2$, we simply square the volume of the submerged portion of the cube:\n\n$$v^2 = (1024\\sqrt{3})^2 = 1024^2 \\times 3 = 10485", "answer_to_ill_with_hint": "To solve this problem, we need to find the volume of water displaced by the cube inside the barrel.

Congruent rectangles are rectangles that have the same dimensions, i.e., the same length and the same width. Since the twelve rectangles are congruent, they all have the same length and the same width.\n\nNow, let's consider the process of flipping the rectangles randomly and placing them together to form the rectangle PQRS. When rectangles are flipped randomly, their orientations change, but their dimensions remain the same.

This means we would use $50$ blocks of each type ($2$-foot and $1$-foot) to ensure the wall is even on the ends.\n\nUsing $1$-foot-long blocks alone would not allow us to achieve staggered joins while keeping the ends even, as we would need to cut blocks to fit the staggered pattern, which is not allowed.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of Blocks\n\nUsing the alternating pattern with $2$-foot and $1$-foot blocks, we have:\n\n- $50$ blocks of $2$ feet length\n- $50$ blocks of $1$ foot length\n\nTherefore, the total number of blocks needed is $50 + 50 = 100$.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe smallest number of blocks needed to build this wall, considering all constraints, is $100$.", "answer_to_ill": "To build the wall, we need to use blocks that are either $2$ feet long or $1$ foot long, with no cutting allowed.

Since each block is $1$ foot high, we need $7$ blocks to reach the full height of the wall. \n\nNow, let's calculate the number of blocks needed for the length. We can use either $2$-foot-long blocks or $1$-foot-long blocks.

Since the vertical joins in the blocks must not be staggered and the wall must be even on the ends, we can deduce the following:\n\n1. **Length of the Blocks**: To maintain an even wall on the ends, the length of the blocks must be a factor of the wall's length. The only factors of $100$ that correspond to the given block lengths are $100$ itself, which is not possible since the blocks are smaller, and $50$, which is also not possible since the blocks cannot be cut. Therefore, the blocks must be arranged in a repeating pattern that covers the entire length of the wall without cutting them.\n\n2. **Pattern of Blocks**: The only viable pattern is to alternate between $2$-foot-long blocks and $1$-foot-long blocks. This pattern will cover the entire length of the wall without any gaps or overlaps.\n\n3. **Number of Blocks**: To find the smallest number of blocks needed, we count the blocks in the pattern that covers the entire length of the wall. Since the pattern alternates between $2$-foot-long blocks and $1$-foot-long blocks, and there are $50$ of each type of block in the pattern, the total number of blocks needed is $50 + 50 = 100$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of blocks needed to build the wall is $100$."}

The diagonals can be drawn by connecting vertices that are not adjacent. The shortest diagonal $b$ connects two vertices that are two sides apart, while the longest diagonal $d$ connects two vertices that are eight sides apart.\n\n### Step 2: Use trigonometry\nConsider a triangle formed by a side $a$, the shortest diagonal $b$, and the angle between them.

A regular nonagon has nine equal sides and nine equal angles. The diagonals of a regular nonagon can be categorized into three types: shortest diagonal, intermediate diagonal, and longest diagonal.\n\nGiven that all sides and diagonals are of equal length, we can denote the length of a side as $a$, the length of the shortest diagonal as $b$, and the length of the longest diagonal as $d$. The intermediate diagonal, which is not explicitly mentioned in the question, would be equal to $b$ since all diagonals are also of equal length.\n\nNow, let's consider the triangle formed by a side, the shortest diagonal, and the longest diagonal. This triangle is an isosceles triangle with two sides of length $a$ and a base of length $d$. Since the triangle is isosceles, the angles opposite the equal sides ($a$) are equal.

There are three types of diagonals:\n  - The shortest diagonal, which connects two vertices that are two sides apart.\n  - The medium diagonal, which connects two vertices that are three sides apart.\n  - The longest diagonal, which connects two vertices that are four sides apart.\n\nThese diagonals are not equal in length.

This rule is crucial for determining the possible placements of the numbers.\n\n3. **Apply the Rules**:\n   - Since 7 and 9 are already placed, we need to ensure that their adjacent numbers satisfy Rule 2.\n   - Let's look at the squares adjacent to 7 and 9:\n     - The squares adjacent to 7 are (6, 7, 8, 1).\n     - The squares adjacent to 9 are (8, 9, 1, 2).\n   - We need to find combinations of numbers that make the sums of these adjacent squares multiples of 3.\n\n4. **Solve for Possible Combinations**:\n   - For the squares adjacent to 7:\n     - If we place 8 in square (6, 7, 8, 1), the sum is 23 (not a multiple of 3).\n     - If we place 1 in square (6, 7, 1, 1), the sum is 15 (a multiple of 3).\n   - For the squares adjacent to 9:\n     - If we place 2 in square (8, 9, 1, 2), the sum is 20 (not a multiple of 3).\n     - If we place 1 in square (8, 9, 1, 1), the sum is 17 (not a multiple of 3).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - The only combination that satisfies Rule 2 is placing 1 in square (6, 7, 1, 1).\n   - This leaves us with six remaining numbers (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8) to place in the other six squares.\n   - There are multiple ways to arrange these six numbers in the remaining"}

However, since the path must be continuous and pass through each circle exactly once, the starting point doesn't affect the total count.

They are arranged in a $2\\times 3$ rectangle, which means there are two rows and three columns of circles. This arrangement is crucial because it determines the possible paths that can be taken.\n\nNext, we need to consider the concept of a continuous path. The path must pass through each circle exactly once, which means it cannot skip any circle and must not revisit a circle after passing through it. This constraint is important because it eliminates certain paths that might otherwise be possible.\n\nGiven these premises, we can now address the question: How many passlocks are there consisting of all six circles?\n\nTo answer this question, we need to count the number of unique paths that satisfy the constraints mentioned above. However, upon closer inspection, we realize that there is a fundamental issue with the question's premises.\n\nThe problem lies in the requirement that the path must pass through each circle exactly once. In a $2\\times 3$ rectangle of circles, it is not possible to create a continuous path that satisfies this condition. The reason is that the circles are not all connected in a way that allows for a single, continuous path to pass through each one exactly once.\n\nFor example, consider the circles in the top row. If the path starts at the leftmost circle, it cannot continue to the rightmost circle without passing through the middle circle twice. Similarly, if the path starts at the middle circle, it cannot continue to the rightmost circle without passing through the leftmost circle twice. This pattern holds true for all possible starting points in the top row.\n\nThe same issue arises for the bottom row and for any path that attempts to connect circles across rows. In every case, the path will inevitably pass through at least one circle more than once, violating the constraint of passing through each circle exactly once.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis of the arrangement and the constraints on the path, we can conclude that there are no passlocks consisting of all six circles on Misha's new phone.

Then, we will find the number of positive integer divisors of this number.\n\nFirst, let's analyze the grid. Each cell contains an integer from $1$ to $12$. We can start by placing the numbers in the first row. Since the average of two adjacent cells must be divisible by $5$, we can deduce that the numbers in the first row must be $1, 6, 11, 2, 7, 12$. This is because the average of $1$ and $6$ is $3.5$, the average of $6$ and $11$ is $8.5$, and so on, ensuring that all averages are divisible by $5$.\n\nNow, let's move to the second row. The numbers in the second row must complement the numbers in the first row to satisfy the divisibility condition. We can place the numbers $3, 8, 10, 4, 9, 5$ in the second row. This placement ensures that the average of any two adjacent cells in both rows is divisible by $5$.\n\nNext, we need to count the number of ways to arrange these numbers in the grid.

This results in a tetrahedron, which is a three-dimensional shape with four triangular faces.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the obtained figure after folding the regular hexagon as described is a tetrahedron.\n\nIn summary, the question's premises are correct, and the resulting shape from the described folding is indeed a tetrahedron."}

The sum of the points on each die's opposite faces could be any even number, not just 7. This is because the dice are not standard.\n2.
