Let's analyze the given dot plot and the conditions step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Initial Distribution\nThe dot plot shows the distribution of test scores for 20 students. The scores are as follows:\n- 65: 2 students\n- 70: 2 students\n- 75: 3 students\n- 80: 4 students\n- 85: 3 students\n- 90: 3 students\n- 95: 2 students\n- 100: 1 student\n\n### Step 2: Calculating the Initial Median\nSince there are 20 students, the median will be the average of the 10th and 11th scores when arranged in increasing order.\n\nFrom the dot plot:\n- The first 2 scores are 65.\n- The next 2 scores are 70.\n- The next 3 scores are 75.\n- The next 4 scores are 80.\n- The next 3 scores are 85.\n- The next 3 scores are 90.\n- The next 2 scores are 95.\n- The last score is 100.\n\nArranging these scores in increasing order:\n\\[ 65, 65, 70, 70, 75, 75, 75, 80, 80, 80, 80, 85, 85, 85, 90, 90, 90, 95, 95, 100 \\]\n\nThe 10th and 11th scores are both 80.

This means that half of the students scored below $80$ and half scored above $80$. To increase the median to $85$, we need to increase the scores of some of the students who scored below $85$ so that the new median is $85$.\n\nLet's assume that the number of students who scored below $85$ is $n$. To increase the median to $85$, we need to increase the scores of at least $\\frac{n}{2}$ students who scored below $85$ to $85$ or above.

This means that the state of the board can be represented by the positions of the \"chomped\" squares. Each square can either be chomped or not chomped, but the chomped squares must form a contiguous block starting from the top-left corner and extending to the right and down.\n\nTo count the number of different subsets, we can think of the board as a grid where each square can be either chomped or not chomped, but with the constraint that if a square is chomped, all squares to its right and below it must also be chomped. This constraint means that the state of the board can be represented by the positions of the \"chomped\" squares, which form a contiguous block starting from the top-left corner.\n\nThe number of different subsets is equivalent to the number of ways to choose a contiguous block of squares starting from the top-left corner. This is equivalent to choosing a point on the grid where the block ends, which can be any point on the grid, including the corners and edges.\n\nFor a 5-by-7 grid, there are 5 rows and 7 columns. The number of different subsets is equivalent to the number of ways to choose a point on the grid where the block ends, which is the number of points on the grid, including the corners and edges.

The question asks for the number of different subsets of the set of 35 unit squares that can occur during the game of Chomp, including the full board and the empty board.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand the rules of Chomp and how the game progresses. In Chomp, players take turns removing squares from the board, and the player who removes the last square loses. The game is played on a rectangular grid, and when a player removes a square, all squares to the right and above the removed square are also removed.\n\nGiven a 5-by-7 grid, we can think of each square as a potential \"bite\" that can be taken. However, not all subsets of squares can be achieved through the game's rules. For example, it's impossible to have a subset where a square is present but the square to its left or below it is absent, as taking a bite would remove all squares to the right and above the chosen square.\n\nTo count the number of different subsets, we can think of the game as a process of removing squares from the full board. Each square can either be removed or not removed, but the removal of a square affects the availability of other squares. This is similar to a binary decision tree, where each node represents a square and each branch represents the decision to remove or not remove that square.\n\nHowever, due to the game's rules, the decision tree is not a simple binary tree. The removal of a square affects the availability of other squares, so the tree has a more complex structure. To count the number of different subsets, we need to consider all possible paths through this tree.\n\nThe number of different subsets is equal to the number of different paths through the decision tree. This is a complex combinatorial problem, and there is no simple formula to calculate the number of different subsets. However, we can use dynamic programming to solve the problem.\n\nLet's define a function f(i, j) as the number of different subsets that can be achieved by removing squares from the i-th row and the j-th column. We can calculate f(i, j) recursively as follows:\n\n- If i = 0 or j = 0, then f(i, j) = 1, as there is only one way to remove all squares from an empty row or column.\n- If i > 0 and j > 0, then f(i, j) = f(i-1, j) +"}

For a graph to have an Eulerian path, it must have exactly zero or two vertices of odd degree. In this case, the graph has vertices $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, and $E$ with degrees $4$, $3$, $3$, $4$, and $3$ respectively.

{"pid": 999, "answer_to_normal": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the different ways we can attach two equilateral triangles to the regular pentagon $ABCDE$ and determine how many of these configurations are non-congruent.\n\n1. **Identify the positions for attaching triangles:**\n   - Each side of the pentagon can have a triangle attached to it.\n   - There are 5 sides, so there are 5 positions where a triangle can be attached.\n\n2. **Count the ways to choose 2 positions out of 5:**\n   - We need to choose 2 out of the 5 positions to attach the triangles.\n   - The number of ways to choose 2 positions out of 5 is given by the combination formula $\\binom{n}{k}$, where $n$ is the total number of items to choose from, and $k$ is the number of items to choose.\n   - Here, $n = 5$ and $k = 2$, so we calculate $\\binom{5}{2}$.\n\n\\[\n\\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10\n\\]\n\n3. **Determine non-congruent configurations:**\n   - We need to consider the symmetry of the pentagon.

Since the pentagon is regular, all sides and angles are equal, and the triangles are also equilateral, meaning all their sides and angles are equal.\n\nThe key factor in determining non-congruence is the orientation of the triangles relative to the pentagon. Each triangle can be attached in one of two orientations: either pointing outward or inward relative to the pentagon. However, since the pentagon is regular and the triangles are equilateral, attaching all triangles in the same orientation (all outward or all inward) will result in congruent figures.\n\nTo create non-congruent figures, we need to vary the orientation of the triangles. The number of non-congruent figures can be determined by considering the different combinations of orientations for the five triangles. Since each triangle can be oriented in two ways (outward or inward), and there are five triangles, the total number of combinations is \\(2^5 = 32\\). However, this includes the two cases where all triangles are oriented the same way (all outward or all inward), which are congruent to each other.\n\nTherefore, the number of non-congruent figures is \\(32 - 2 = 30\\). However, this calculation assumes that each unique combination of orientations results in a non-congruent figure, which is not necessarily the case due to the symmetry of the pentagon. Some combinations may result in figures that are congruent due to rotational symmetry.\n\nTo accurately determine the number of non-congruent figures, we would need to consider the symmetries of the pentagon and how they affect the orientation of the triangles. This involves more complex combinatorial and symmetry analysis, which goes beyond the scope of this explanation. However, the initial calculation provides an upper bound on the number of non-congruent figures that can be constructed.", "answer_to_ill_with_hint": "To determine the number of non-congruent figures that can be constructed by attaching equilateral triangles to the sides of a pentagon, we need to consider the different ways the triangles can be arranged.\n\n1. **All triangles on the same side**: If all five triangles are attached to the same side of the pentagon, they will form a single large equilateral triangle. This is one unique configuration.\n\n2. **Triangles on adjacent sides**: If the triangles are attached to adjacent sides of the pentagon, they will form a star shape. Since the pentagon has five sides, there are five possible starting points for this configuration, but they are all congruent to each other because the pentagon is regular and the triangles are equilateral. This is another unique configuration.\n\n3. **Triangles on non-adjacent sides**: If the triangles are attached to non-adjacent sides, the configuration will depend on the specific sides chosen. However, due to the symmetry of the pentagon, any configuration of triangles on non-adjacent sides will be congruent to another configuration obtained by rotating the pentagon. Therefore, there is only one unique configuration for this case as well.\n\nIn total, there are three non-congruent figures that can be constructed by attaching equilateral triangles to the sides of a pentagon: one where all triangles are on the same side, one where triangles are on adjacent sides, and one where triangles are on non-adjacent sides.\n\nThus, the answer is \\(\\boxed{3}\\)."}
